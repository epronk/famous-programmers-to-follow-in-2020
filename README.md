Jim Rohn famously said that we are the average of the five people we spend the most time with. This applies to work too.

Imagine you could surround yourself with people like Bill Gates, James Gosling, Uncle Bob, Elon Musk, Quincy Larson, and other brilliant engineers, developers and entrepreneurs. Imagine you could freely exchange ideas and share knowledge with all of them. 

Most of these brilliant minds openly share knowledge. They write books, give talks, have Twitter accounts. This is what makes them great; they change communities, change lives, and make the world a better place.

Below you will see the list of 101 great minds that inspire developers. The list was generated by a survey of 400 developers. 

If you find the list imperfect, please [take the survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/LDT6BMK) and help make a better list.

The purpose of this list is to help you find people that are role models. By following them, learning from them we can become better developers ourselves. And the world needs inspirational people now more than ever.
